Question 1:

Composite design pattern will be used to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Pseudo Code:

1. Firstly, create a base component or interface which will have methods common to all the objects.
   interface Equipment{
            netPrice();
            powerConsumption();
   }
2.Then create classes that implements this interface.
    class Component implements Equipment
3.Then create a SubComponent classes that implement Component which has the method to add the sub components like the bus that incorporates the network card.
4. Use the objects created from this class to call the methods netPrice() and powerConsumption().
